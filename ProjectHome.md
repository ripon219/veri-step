This stepper motor controller is intended to cover a wide range of stepper motor control needs along with a number of other motor control and driving applications. The hardware is capable of driving any type of stepper motor up to 10A per phase with closed loop current control and microstepping. The board can also be used to drive up to 4 DC motors simultaneously, or any other device requiring < 10A of controlled current. Configurations and control can be made through USB or I2C.
